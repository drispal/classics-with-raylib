This personnal project is a lookalike of the famous game Space Invaders. The goal was to recreate this game in C++ by using a game library : Raylib.

## To start

1. Download the entire project
2. You can launch the game through Visual Studio 2019 or by the Space Invader.exe file in the directory Debug.

**WARNING :** If you choose to launch the game with VS2019, be sure that you use x86.

## Controls

Use left and right arrow keys to move your spaceship and press space bar to shoot.

## Improvments

The project can be improved in many ways :
* Better balancing of the game
* End of the game when an invader reach the bottom (That is the original end game mechanic)
* Cancel ennemy missile by shooting it
* Add bonus
* Add different kinds of ennemies

## Made with

* [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/fr/vs/) - Visual Studio 2019
* [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) - Raylib.h
