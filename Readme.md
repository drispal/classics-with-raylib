The goal of this personnal project was to recreate famous games from the 80's in C++ by using the game library [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/).
There is a lot of room for improvment and some bugs may occur but the idea is here.

## Games

## Raylib

Raylib is a cross-platform open-source software development library with the aim to simply create graphical games (and other graphical developement projects).
It was first released by [Ramon Santamaria](https://github.com/raysan5) in 2013.

The library inspired by the Borland BGI graphics library and by the XNA framework. The source code is written in C and it aims to be easy for beginners, distributed under a zlib/libpng OSI certified open-source license. It supports compilation to several target platforms as Windows, Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, Android, Raspberry Pi and HTML5.
