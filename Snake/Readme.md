This personnal project is a lookalike of the famous game Snake. The goal was to recreate this game in C++ by using a game library : Raylib.

## To start

1. Download the entire project
2. You can launch the game through Visual Studio 2019 or by the Pong.exe file in the directory Debug.

**WARNING :** If you choose to launch the game with VS2019, be sure that you use x86.

## Controls

Use ARROW KEYS to move the snake through the screen, you can go out the screen but if touch your tail you loose.

## Made with
